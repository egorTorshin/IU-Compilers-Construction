# IU-Compilers-Construction
This is a repository for Compiler Construction in Innopolis University where me and my teammate should make compiler for language I in Java

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

```bash
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
```

```bash
javac -cp "target/classes;target/dependency/*" TestAll.java
```

```bash
java -cp ".;target/classes;target/dependency/*" TestAll
```

```bash
mvn test
```
